tcpdump is a most powerful and widely used command-line packets sniffer or package analyzer tool which is used to capture or filter TCP/IP packets that are received or transferred over a network on a specific interface.

13. Capture all packets in any interface
`````````````````````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i any









14. Capture specific host
``````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i ens33 host x.x.x.x





IDS/IPS (SPI/DPI)
```````````````````

What is a Intrusion Detection System?
`````````````````````````````````````
- An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a network for malicious activity or policy violations. 

- Some IDSâ€™s are capable of responding to detected intrusion upon discovery.

IDS Detection Types
````````````````````
+ Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS)
````````````````````````````````````````````
	- A system/hardware that analyzes incoming network traffic.




+ Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS)
```````````````````````````````````````````````
	- A system that monitors important operating system files.




+ Protocol-based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS):
```````````````````````````````````````````````````
	- It is trying to secure the web server by regularly monitoring the HTTPS protocol stream and accept the related HTTP protocol.



+ Application Protocol-based Intrusion Detection System (APIDS):
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
	- It identifies the intrusions by monitoring and interpreting the communication on application-specific protocols.

+ Hybrid Intrusion Detection System :
`````````````````````````````````````
	- In the hybrid intrusion detection system, host agent or system data is combined with network information to develop a complete view of the network system.


Detection Method of IDS:
`````````````````````````
+ Signature-based:
``````````````````
- looking for specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic
- Although signature-based IDS can easily detect known attacks
- it is impossible to detect new attacks, for which no pattern is available.



+ Anomaly-based:
````````````````
- a newer technology designed to detect and adapt to unknown attacks
- detection method uses machine learning to create a defined model of trustworthy activity, and then compare new behavior against this trust model.

What is an Intrusion Prevention System?
```````````````````````````````````````

- An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is an network security device used to monitor and respond to potential threats.

- The main functions of an IPS are to identify suspicious activity, log relevant information, attempt to block the activity, and finally to report it.

Detection mechanisms:
`````````````````````

- Address matching
- HTTP string and substring matching
- Generic pattern matching
- TCP connection analysis
- Packet anomaly detection
- Traffic anomaly detection
- TCP/UDP port matching


IPS Classifications
```````````````````

Network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS): 
`````````````````````````````````````````````````
- Analyzes protocol activity across the entire network, looking for any untrustworthy traffic.

Wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS): 
````````````````````````````````````````````
- Analyzes network protocol activity across the entire wireless network, looking for any untrustworthy traffic.

Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS):
``````````````````````````````````````````````
- that follows a single host for malicious activity, and analyzes events occurring within said host.

IPS Detection Methods
`````````````````````
Signature-based detection: 
``````````````````````````
- Signature-based IDS monitors packets in the network and compares with predetermined attack patterns, known as â€œsignaturesâ€.

Statistical anomaly-based detection: 
````````````````````````````````````
- An anomaly-based IPS will monitor network traffic and compare it to expected traffic patterns. 

- The baseline will identify what is "normal" for that network â€“ what sort of packets generally through the network and what protocols are used.

- it may raise a false positive alarms




15. Complex expressions
````````````````````````
# tcpdump -i lo src 127.0.0.1 and port 80


# tcpdump -i lo "port 80 and (src x.x.x.x or src x.x.x.x)"




Network Operations with Scapy
------------------------------

Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation/crafting program/framework.

+ Install it

# apt install scapy -y
OR
# yum install epel-release -y
# yum install scapy -y

+ Interective shell:

# scapy

ICMP example:
``````````````````` 
ip.src eq 1.1.1.1 && ip.dst eq 8.8.8.8



>>> x = IP()
>>> y = ICMP()
>>> x.show()
>>> y.show()

>>> x.src="x.x.x.x"
>>> x.dst="x.x.x.x"

>>> send(x/y/"LOLOLOLOL")
or
>>> send(x/y, count=10)
or 
>>> send(x/y, loop=1)

Send TCP Packets:
----------
>>> a = IP()
>>> b = TCP()
>>> a.src="x.x.x.x"
>>> a.dst="196.1.113.45"
>>> b.sport=53
>>> b.dport=80

>>> send((a/b), count=10)
